That was the day I started to “eat better” and it was brutal. It worked, and I made progress, but I was going the wrong way about it. I was going purely on my daily calorie intake; and I had cut it down to 800 calories/day. I wanted to lose weight and I didn’t want to exercise. The first few months seemed to go by pretty well; I was losing a steady 10 pounds a month. And then it stopped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I had read many times that a simple calorie deficit would do this: you’d lose weight quickly and then BAM! you’d plateau. The second you start eating more your body would begin gaining weight. As soon as this started to happen, I tried to retaliate. I started going to the gym.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It was hard; due to my calorie deficit I was low on energy but it worked. I kept losing weight, little by little. I kept losing little by little until it slowly stopped. The last month of trying to lose weight, I lost none. I gave up. Summer had set in, nothing I was doing seemed to help me lose weight and my birthday was right around the corner. I lost 50 pounds in 6 months. From 321 pounds, I was down to 270 pounds. I was extremely happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    As summer went along, I started to slip. I’d have a burger here, some fires here, a bag of buttered popcorn, some potato chips with lunch and so on. I’ve gained 10 pounds since I stopped losing. Now, I haven’t reverted back to my old ways, I eat much better than I used to. I used to eat a family sized bag of chips by myself at night. I would drink 2 liters of normal Mountain Dew throughout the day. All I would eat was junk food and dinner. I don’t do that now, but I can still do better.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Hitting 280 pounds again scared me. I seemingly “ruined my life” to lose all that weight and I was slowly gaining it back. I was not about to let that happen. It was time to get back on the bandwagon and shave off some more body fat. The last thing I wanted to do was NOT go on another calorie deficit diet. So I researched. I found /r/keto. The basis of the diet is no carbs. It’s very similar to the popular paleo (caveman) diet. You’re supposed to eat nothing but meat, vegetables, nuts and cheese. It’s supposed to get your body into “ketosis”, or back to using the fat reservoirs as energy instead of carbs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I loved the idea; it sounded like something I could do. And then I started thinking: no bread, no pasta, no rice, no potatoes, no starch and no sugar. I’m sure it would work, but I don’t know if it’s that practical. In this day in age you can’t eat out and avoid carbs, and there’s also too many temptations. I don’t know if I could never have a sandwich again, or some home-made pizza. The diet requires that you be strict for the full intended effect. So, I’m bagging it and coming up with a new regimen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    But before I go there, I have to cover my realization. While reading and researching – I found out what I was doing wrong. I had the cause and effect backwards. My mindset was that I was eating better to lose weight. That’s the wrong way to think about it. I should be losing weight because I am eating better. And I should be eating better just to be healthier. If my cause to eat better is to lose weight, I’ll lose motivation the second I stop losing weight. But if my motivation to eat healthy, I’ll have all the motivation in the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With this mentality, my goal to simply eat better and get fit. It’s hard to define what that means because everyone’s body is different, their mindsets are different and their standards are different. My main goal is keep carbs down. That means LESS starchy food. If I have rice, or pasta, it won’t be the main dish. If I have potatoes it won’t be fries or mashed potatoes. I want to eat more meat and vegetables and less grain. I don’t want a giant sub roll, but maybe a wrap, or just slices of bread. Instead of cheese and crackers, I’ll try to eat nuts and cheese. Instead of buttered popcorn, I’ll have yeast popcorn. Instead of mashed potatoes, I’ll have mashed cauliflower. Instead of frozen peas, I’ll have steamed spinach. Instead of battered, fried shrimp, I’ll have grilled or seared shrimp. I also want to keep up with the gym. That doesn’t mean the elliptical for 20 minutes once a week; I want to work towards getting fit. That means my whole body, from my calves to my abs to arms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    All in all (TL;DR), I’m going to get back to attempting to lose weight. But not for the sake of losing weight, I want to for the sake of being healthy. I’m going try to have a better, more balanced diet instead of a simple daily calorie count. I want to go to the gym to improve my body, not to burn calories. I want to get healthy, not lose weight. But hey, losing weight would be nice too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    EDIT: I accidentally some words.\r\n</p>'),
('adventure-time', 'Adventure Time!', '2012-12-03 12:00:00', '<p>\r\n    In many projects I’ve worked on that resembled games, the movement was always the wall I’d hit and couldn’t get over. I often tried to dive head first, and reinvent the wheel with real physics, collision detection, proper resolution and so on. It was so overwhelming whenever I had previously attempted that I would end up disbanding the project.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This time I took a step back and thought “the movement for this game doesn’t have to be complex. There’s no real time combat, there’s no need to go diagonal.” I decided I would make the movement much like the ever so popular Pokemon games. You move tile to tile, one at a time. You can never occupy more than one tile at a time, and you can’t go diagonal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This method of moving around the world became very easy to program. Collision was as simple as checking to see if the tile the player was trying to move into was occupied tile (by another entity), or was a “blocked” tile ID. While moving between tiles, I did a simple linear interpolation which allowed for a smooth, continuous walking movement if a player was to hold down a movement key.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This method still allows for everything I needed: the ability to interact with other entities, go through “transportation/teleport” tiles, trigger combat and last but not least look good. With help from Julie, I think this game will end up looking great.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    On a side note, I’ve also finally caught up on JavaDoc for all my code in addition to updating my current UML map. All of which can be found (including the current build of the game) on the project page: Click Here.\r\n</p>'),
('classes-skills-and-weapons', 'Classes, Skills and Weapons', '2012-11-25 12:00:00', '<p>\r\n    The Name of the project has changed since this post. It is no longer known as “Chaotic Harmony”, but as “The Wayward Crown”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It’s been a productive weekend. I’ve spent many hours with my brother working out the kinks in the overall game design. I knew going into this project how difficult it would be to create a balanced role playing game with multiple classes, weapons, skills and so on. Not until now can I appreciate the time and effort some game developers put into the design and balance of their games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The biggest hurdle was balancing the multiple classes. At first, we were attempting to keep the classes similar in power but we ended up have 4 of the same classes with different skill names. It had the illusion of variance, but they all had the same underlying abilities. We came up with 4 final classes. I’ll go over each in detail.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Mages offer strong magical offense and defense but cannot put out or take much physical damage. In addition to their raw damage mages can also inflict damaging conditions to their enemies. They have a very low base health.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Rangers are the jack of all trades. Most damage and defense attributes are moderate. But rangers do have a one up in their dexterity and debilitation. With increased dexterity they are better at evading attacks and striking first. They are masters of conditions dealing damage over time and keeping enemy stats down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Warriors are the opposite of mages. They have very high endurance and strength as well as a high base health stat. They have a slow dexterity making them almost always attack last and have a hard time evading attacks. They’re clunky.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Paladins can’t put out a lot of damage but they offer a lot of stat modifications. Paladins can heal team mates, remove conditions, buff team mate’s stats and lessen the enemies. They have a moderate amount of defense for both physical and magical damage. They have a low stamina, and can’t cast many strong spells in succession.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In addition to the classes being constructed, I’ve documented available weapons for each class, and how they are used. Skills are also described including how they are used and how to unlock more. There’s too much that has changed to include in one blog post. If you’re still wondering about what’s new I suggest you check out the whole design document on the project page. Click here to go to that page.\r\n</p>'),
('design-layout-and-uml', 'Design Layout and UML', '2012-11-23 14:00:00', '<p>\r\n    The Name of the project has changed since this post. It is no longer known as “Chaotic Harmony”, but as “The Wayward Crown”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I’ve started to think more about how the inner game workings will be structured in addition to the game’s overall design. My main goal was to be able to work on certain parts of the project while other parts are still being pieced together. The game has multiple systems going on at the same time, but they don’t all rely on each other. The four main parts of the game will be: User Input, Screen Display, Game State Manager and the Role Playing Manager.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The input system is pretty straight forward. Accessible to most object, subsystems can test for keystrokes, mouse movements and register listeners. Obviously I’ve separate the Keyboard and Mouse. Hopefully by constructing the input methods on the outside of the game itself, it will make it easier for things like player movement, in game menus and combat systems easier to hook into and not have to fight over each other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Next is the Screen Display system. This will also have access to the Game State Manager. Each game state will have it’s own drawing functionality, and the drawer class will simply call such a method. This allows for completely different drawing methods for each state allowing for a lot of customability in terms of the rendering for each game state. In turn it does create more work for me, but I think the trade off is worth the modularity I gain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Game State Manager is the real meat of the program. This is what controls what parts of the game that are currently active. It will load new Combat States when the player encounters enemies, it will create new Adventure states when the player goes through doors, etc. This is what will allow the game to be more than a single camera in a 2D world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Role Playing Manage is the meat of the game. The the State Manager controls the game’s state, while this will hold the players state. This will keep track of all quests, character stats, inventories, skill development, etc. All States will interact with this manager throughout gameplay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    My goal for the near future is to setup the Display and Input Systems. Once that’s finished, I’ll begin work on the State Manager with a simple “dummy” state for the time being. I think getting these fundamental systems up and running is the first and biggest leap. Once that’s done, I can work on each system separately.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I’ve enjoyed using UML (though I’m sure I’m not using it 100% accurately). It’s definitely helping me keep track of my thought process and layout a plan for what has to happen. I plan to keep it updated as I work on this project. I may not include every method and every variable, but enough to keep the structure understandable and to help me continue to work on this project.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Below you can see the small (poorly detailed) map of the systems I’ve described above.</p>\r\n</p>'),
('developmental-differences-lrk-twc', 'Developmental Differences (LRK vs. TWC)', '2013-07-22 07:59:48', '<p>\r\nIt’s been a while since I’ve made an actual post about my recent works. Most posts have been a placeholder for videos, or commit notes. But I haven’t gone into depth about any of it. I feel it’s time to delve into my experiences thus far while working on Lost Relics of Kazar (LRK).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn my first post about this game (and the on its project page) I talked about how I had scaled everything down to make it more manageable for me, the only main developer (a small shout out to my first and only contributor: Jason “Whitebread” Bunn). The idea was to make development time shorter and get it over with faster. This idea has actually backfired. Thankfully, it backfired in a good way. With less complex systems, I’m finding myself trying to make everything perfect; and thus learning more from my mistakes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTWC was so big and complex I would make the subsystems work, stop there and move on. In LRK I tend to follow the following steps for each system I work on: Lay it out on paper; make it work; play with it; tear (some of) it down; improve the system; rinse and repeat “n” times. It sounds bad and inefficient, but I find it very educational. It allows me to criticize what was good and bad about my initial designs and allows me to get me used to the libraries and methods I’m using. I’d also like to mention that I don’t always rebuild the entire system (though that has happened), nor do I make this a never ending cycle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy doing this, the pieces of LRK are fitting together much better than TWC and development gets smoother and smoother as more and more pieces are put together. Overall, I’m enjoying my development on LRK much more than TWC because I am giving myself more time to make things correctly and cleanly. Not to mention all the JavaDoc I’ve been able to keep up with *smiley face*.\r\n</p>'),
('keto', '...Keto!', '2013-01-12 00:00:00', '<p>\r\n    A while back I made a post about my recent change in diet and readjust from my weight gain relapse. I said that I was thinking of using the Keto dieting method, but I ruled it too difficult in the world we live in today. The Keto diet has only one restriction: stick below ~25g of carbohydrates a day. In doing so, you force your body to start using Fat as its primary source of energy instead of carbohydrates. Over time  your body stops using carbohydrates as energy and uses all fat. This literately forces your body to begin eating away at your body fat, instead of a steady stream of carbohydrates.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This diet limits your available options a lot. Things like bread, noodles, non-diet sodas, ice cream, 2% milk, potatoes, fruits, juices, etc are all no-goes. This is why it was so daunting. The upside is that it’s the only diet that allows you to have eggs and bacon for breakfast, chicken wings for lunch and some fatty steak for dinner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I started about 5 days ago. Monday night, I spontaneously said to myself, “Why not? Lets just try out Keto…” From that point on, I’ve been at less than 20g of carbs per day. I have done so with a lot of guidance from /r/keto. The Keto sub-Reddit has posted so many successful progress pictures, testimonials, and proof that Keto works, that I just HAD to try it out.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The first day was the worst. I hadn’t “Keto” shopped yet, and I was craving food badly. All I had was a bag of almonds, some cheese and roast beef. Thankfully we had steak that night. All day I was craving things like bread, or pretzels. Two days go on, and I keep a strict Keto diet. During these days, I started to get the predicted symptoms. I felt fatigued, and out of energy, my mouth tasted like a tin can, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    On day 4, I decide to pickup some Ketostix on the way to work – they test to see if your body is producing ketones (a byproduct of burning fat for energy). I get to work, and sure enough I am in ketosis – SAWEET! Friday and today (Saturday) have been eye opening. This is the first time where I have truly not been “hungry” in my recent memory. I didn’t crave food, and when I did just a little amount of food would fill me up. Some restaurant meticulously placed a basket of bread in front of me – but I was unturned. Sure, it smelled good, but I didn’t crave it. I didn’t feel like I needed to eat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Almost a week in, and I’ve lost my predicted 5 pounds of water weight, plus an additional 5 pounds of fat. I look forward to sticking with this diet – I’ve already become a sort of fan boy of it. The only thing I dread of this diet is the cost of new clothes…\r\n</p>'),
('koch-fractal-animation', 'Koch Fractal Animation', '2012-11-21 12:00:00', '<p>\r\n    For school, I was required to animate the transformation of a equilateral triangle to a simple Koch Snowflake. Once I completed that task I decided to go a little further. I enjoyed the fact that this fractal looked the same no matter how far you zoomed into a corner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The animation I made has 4 corners of Koch Snowflake, 2 of which are “zooming” in, and other 2 out. All at the same time, it’s rotating and changing colors. Here is the animation.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="center"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9JV3yEpjDdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<p>\r\n    For some reason, during recording, there is a “laggy” part of the video. It’s not jumpy like the video when it’s actually running. I’m going to blame Fraps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    At first I thought that I should of simply generate new points as I zoomed in but I realized that could get computationally heavy, and it would quickly get obscured as rounding errors occur with smaller and smaller floating point numbers. So I generated a Koch Snowflake after 7 iterations. I found that at the resolution I was animating this, you couldn’t differentiate between the 6th and 7th iteration so I could easily zoom in and out between the 6th and 7th iteration without losing any detail.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Once I had this array of points (which was a lot), I never had to generate anymore. For each corner, I used the same set of points, and I would translate the corner of the triangle to the origin. From there I could rotate and scale the triangle and the corner would stay on top of the origin. Once I got this coded, I was able to do it 3 more time with a simple loop and adjust the rotation for each.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The next step was to figure out how to scale the triangle to zoom in one iteration, and then “un-scale” it back to it’s original size. This would create the illusion that it was “forever” zooming into the point. At first, I was doing this linearly but as the triangle was scaled larger and larger the animation seem to slow down, and speed up really quickly when the scale went back to 1.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Now that I could create the illusion that it was zooming in forever, I had to figure out to smooth the “zooming”. To do this, instead of scaling the zoom factor linearly, I did it exponentially. This allowed the scale to grow faster, as it required more scaling to zoom in at the same speed. Now, it’s all working smoothly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The rest of the animation was pretty trivial. There were a few primitives used to generate the colors and rotation. This is no where near a complete project, but more of a temporary sandbox I used to get used to OpenGL. I would like to see it turn into a music visualization someday – but that will be for a later date.\r\n</p>'),
('lighting-and-shadows', '2D Lighting and Shadows', '2013-08-16 14:06:17', '<p>\r\n    I spent a good amount of time on my "lighting engine" and I''m very happy with the result (so far). There''s still quite a bit that I want to do with the lighting but that will have to be for another day. As of right now, I''ve tackled the most important thing (in my book): shadows. Without shadows, LRK''s lighting system is VERY similar to TWC''s (with a few improvements). It took a lot of work to get to where I am now and I thought what I learned was worth sharing. For the first time on my blog I''m going to go over how I did what I did. Once that''s done, I''ll briefly go over what I could do better and what I have planned for my lighting engine''s future.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Light Map</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    The general method to my lighting engine is as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Create a new Frame Buffer (light map) to draw the light map on.</li>\r\n    <li>Fill the light map with the ambient light color</li>\r\n    <li>Draw the lights to the light map with an additive blend mode.</li>\r\n    <li>Draw the light map over the game''s graphics component with a multiplicative blend mode.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    To add shadows, I do this for each light before I draw it to the light map:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Draw the light image to another Frame Buffer (light buffer).</li>\r\n    <li>Tint the light buffer with the light''s color by filling the light buffer with a color while using a multiplicative blend function.</li>\r\n    <li>Draw the shadows over the light buffer in black.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    Here are some visuals to help you follow along.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    For comparison here is what the game looked like before I added any kind of lighting.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/1.jpg" alt="No Lighting" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    The first step is to create the light map and fill it with ambient light. For this demonstration, I am not using a blend function to draw the light map so it''s easier to see what''s going on.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/2.jpg" alt="Ambient Light Map" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    Then, I draw each light over the light map.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/3.jpg" alt="Light Images added" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    For each light, I fill the light buffer with the light''s color using a multiplicative blend function. (Note, this is not the actual order of drawing, I would tint the image as I draw it. I separated the steps here to make it easier to follow.)\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/4.jpg" alt="Light Images added with Hue" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    Then for each light I remove the shadows (I''ll go over this later) by simply drawing a black polygon where the shadow should be. (Again, this should be done to the light buffer BEFORE drawing the light to the light map.)\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/5.jpg" alt="Shadows removed from each light image" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    To add the lights to the light map in a "lighty" way, I draw each light buffer to the light map with an additive blend function. You can see the sources of light and their shadows very well here.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/6.jpg" alt="Drawing the light masks with an additive blend mode" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    Now, when I draw the light map to the game''s scene I use a multiplicative blend function and TA-DAH, light has been born.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/7.jpg" alt="Drawing the light map over the game with a multiply blend mode" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    To make the render distance (which is determined by the light the character is holding) less harsh, I draw a simple vignette around the images (which is just a scaled, transparent, black image).\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/8.jpg" alt="Added the Vignette to the game for cutoff" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    And for a final comparison. The difference is night and day - lighting adds so much more to the game than I thought it would.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/9.jpg" alt="And before and after comparison" />\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center;">\r\n    Here''s a live-action demo of the lighting in action. This video also features a giant horde of slimes and an OP player.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="center">\r\n  <iframe width="420" height="315"\r\n     src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9hzpe24lHlo"\r\n     frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shadows</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    I would not of been able to work out these shadows without the help of this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BtjcH-iLR0" targe="_blank">Here</a>. I would strongly suggest you watch that video if you really want to understand how this works as he gives a lot of good visuals. I will admit, I have become a bit of a graphics softie thanks to using Slick2D, so I adopted his method and came up with another, less efficient way to go about it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    When I load the map, I create the 2D world with JBox2D based on a collision layer in the Tiled map. When I create a static wall with JBox2D, I also keep an array of lines (2 points) for each wall''s edge. I use these lines as "light blockers". After I draw the light image to the light buffer, I pass the light buffer, the lights position and other world data to a method. This method then goes through each of these shadow lines that intersect the light''s affected area.\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/10.jpg" alt="Diagram of the light buffer with shadow math" />\r\n<p>\r\n    This diagram shows the light image, 5 points, the shadow line and the triangle of light we''re working with. For each shadow line (here the line is A,B), you can make a triangle of light that should be shown (here it''s the triangle L,A,B). If we think of this triangle as a point and 2 vectors (point L with vectors L>A and L>B) we can scale the vectors equally to create a similar (larger) triangle (L,X,Y). Then, if we subtract the original triangle from this bigger one we end up with a polygon (A,X,Y,B) that encloses the space the shadow this line produces from this light. Once we have that polygon, we can simply draw it over the light buffer as so:\r\n</p>\r\n<img class="centered" src="/img/posts/lighting-and-shadows/11.jpg" alt="the polygon with the shadow drawn." />\r\n<p>\r\n    I left the point of the light and the shadow line in this image for demonstration. Also note the dark grey is outside of the light buffer and is not actually drawn to the screen. This happens for every shadow line we have.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What I Could Do Better</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    There is one major thing I could do more efficiently, but for right now the system is alright as performance is not hurt too harshly from my not-so-efficient ways. As described in the above video, the best way to implement the 2D shadows is to draw a triangle fan that is constructed by clipping a quad where there is an intersecting shadow line with the light''s image as the texture. This would give many less draw calls and less resources. If I implemented it this way, each light could be drawn directly to the light map without the need of a separate buffer to draw the shadows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Another minor issue is the number of calculations per frame I have to make for each light. Most lights are static in their position. I don''t plan to have moving entities that create light shadows, so I could pre-calculate each triangle fan or shadow map when the light is generated. If I use this method, I would have to update any lights'' shadow maps when the surrounding environment changes (door opens, gate closes, etc).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Future</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    The biggest thing I''d like to add in the future is a shader to blur the shadow edges. This would do a couple things:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>It''s would ease the shadows by keeping the shadow/light contrast from being so sharp.</li>\r\n    <li>It would add the illusion of the umbra family. (more realistic lighting)</li>\r\n    <li>And finally it would allow the player to better see the edges of the surrounding walls'' textures which would add more character to each map.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    Another small thing I''d like to do is to adjust the blending function of the lights being drawn to the light map. Right now, things can become very "washed" when there are lights close together. In TWC I combated this with alpha blending, but lights that are drawn later still overpower lights drawn before it. I''m not sure if there is a better way to go about this blending, but I want there to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\r\n    Well, that''s it for now. ''till next time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\r\n    PS: I would like to give a shout out to John Smith for this John Smith''s texture pack. I used textures from his Minecraft texture pack for this demo.\r\n</p>'),

It is no longer known as “Chaotic Harmony”, but as “The Wayward Crown”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    After a lot of thought and a lot of reading I’ve decided to go with Slick2D for the rendering of the game. I’ll also be utilizing the inner game loop Slick2D offers. Slick2D also offers many listeners for user input that’s a bit more functional and aimed towards games. Because of this change, the overall design of the software has changed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The GameDriver object is the main class of the game. Each system has a Manager class. The driver will extend the Slick2D game object which inherits the automatic game loop. This takes care of the render calls and delta calculations. The driver also inherits the display with very little configuration. Slick2D has done a lot of the graphics work that was a little daunting to me but one thing I’d like to make a point of is that I’m not trying to cut corners, but I wasn’t about to reinvent the wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The biggest thing I accomplished since my last post was the StateManager. I’ve made a very simple, but powerful StateManager that the driver uses. A State acts as an input listener, updater and renderer. Each loop, the driver tells the state manager to udpate and draw the current state. It is very easy to dynamically create and set new states. States can create and set other states themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For example, while in an AdventureState, you could trigger a fight. The AdventureState would generate a CombatState, and pass itself. Then the AdvnetureState would set the current state to the generated CombatState. Once the fighting has finished, the CombatState simply sets the current state as the passed AdventureState.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This state system allows each State to have its own update function and render function. It also allows for states to force an update or render of other states. I’ll be using this with the pause menu. Allowing me to render the adventure state (but not update it), and render the menu right over it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The next step will be to start work on the RPGManager. This is what will handle any save files, character stats, quests, inventories, and so on. In the process of this, I will also have to figure out how to construct the quest system and the skill branching. I believe these will be the hardest part in this manager as both become very complex. Thankfully, I think they’ll both be very similar and I’ll be able to learn from the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I still have a lot ahead of me, but I am ecstatic about the progress I’ve made. I’ve had a wonderful time working on this including all the leaps and hurdles. My goal is to have a finished product by the end of my summer break. At this rate, I feel I’ll be pretty close to my target.\r\n</p>'),
('story-lore-and-characters', 'Story, Lore and Characters', '2012-11-29 12:00:00', '<p>\r\n    It seems like every step I’ve made towards making this game is more difficult than the last. Thankfully it just keeps getting more and more fun. One of the major roadblocks preventing the game from progressing more was the lack of a solid story the game was based on. Thanks to the help from my little brother, Jack, I’ve finally made some headway. When I was trying to come up with ideas for the story there were a few things I was trying to avoid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The last thing I wanted was for my story to be completely linear. I don’t necessarily mean quest wise, but more story wise. In the original Mario, there is a very straight forward story: Princess kidnapped; rescue princess; get kissed. I wanted twists, multiple characters, intertwined stories; I wanted my game to be fun to play and fun to follow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I also didn’t want the story to be too generic. Again, the princess rescue squad has been done a thousand times. The story I came up with may a generic foundation of an idea, but I hope the way I executed it makes it stand out form other games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With any story, characters are important. Because of this, I wanted my characters to be more than relatable, but believable as well. In Pokemon, the main character defeats a national crime ring every year at the age of 10. while the audience can relate to the main character, I find it hard to believe a 10 year old is more effective than the Celadon police department. I feel like the characters made and their actions are believable as well that the player is able to relate to them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In short the story is simple. The main character’s father vanishes when he is a child. When he grows older, he finds clues to his father’s location. While searching for his father, he gets tied up in a rebellion and a greater force of evil. It’s a combination of 3 main plots going on at the same time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In addition to coming up with a story, we also came up with most of the main characters. Each character is some how related to the main character, and has their own goals and age. We hope this will help coming up with quests later on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I won’t go into more detail here about the story or characters but please read up on them here: Google Docs. Till next time!\r\n</p>'),
('the-wayward-crown', 'The Wayward Crown', '2012-11-23 13:00:00', '<p>\r\n    The Name of the project has changed since this post. It is no longer known as “Chaotic Harmony”, but as “The Wayward Crown”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For a long, long time I’ve wanted to make something that would bring entertainment and joy to peoples’ lives. I’ve made my fair share of simple programs that do pretty mundane tasks and I think it’s time I take a stab at a bigger project. A DJ that I listen to often (Tiesto) was once asked in an interview: “Why do you make the music you make?” to which his response was: “I make music that I want to listen to.” That really hit home to me as I am sure it would with many people. The last thing I want to do is dedicate my life to something I don’t like or don’t want to do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    That brings me to the game. As one would assume, I’ve always enjoyed a good role playing game. Titles such as Golden Sun, Final Fantasy and Pokemon are what defined my childhood. I don’t plan on making the biggest game title this year, but I also don’t expect to buckle up for a weekend and make a game. I want to make a product from start to finish the way it’s meant to be developed. To me, this means everything from UML to Documentation to testers. Granted this won’t be a project of a lifetime, there probably won’t be more than a couple friends involved with making the game, but I want my first “real project” to be done right to help set the path for the rest of my career.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The first question is obviously: What language? Java is the language I know best. I also am a big fan of Java’s motto “Compile once, run anywhere”. Of course that motto isn’t 100% accurate, but the idea just makes too much sense. Constructing this game in Java would allow for Windows users, Mac users and Linux users to play the final product. It would also allow for easy translation to an Android app if the future holds such a path.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I’ve already started working on a small “Design Doc”. It’s not structured correctly yet, it’s still more of a notepad I’ve used to keep my ideas straight. You can find the current Design Document here: Chaotic Harmony. The goal is to create a game similar to Golden Sun, my favorite game series. I want to make the game a kind of homage to Golden Sun – while introducing aspects of different games like Final Fantasy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    As many RPGs, I want to the biggest part (other than the story) to be the combat. Combat will hold many options allowing users to create combos with multiple characters, moderated attacks and an advanced turn based system. I look forward to working on this game further and keeping people updated via this Blog of mine.\r\n</p>'),
