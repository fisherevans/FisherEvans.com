('2d-lighting-and-shadows', '<p>I spent a good amount of time on my "lighting engine" and I''m very happy with the result (so far). There''s still quite a bit that I want to do with the lighting but that will have to be for another day. As of right now, I''ve tackled the most important thing (in my book): shadows. Without shadows, LRK''s lighting system is VERY similar to TWC''s (with a few improvements). It took a lot of work to get to where I am now and I thought what I learned was worth sharing. For the first time on my blog I''m going to go over how I did what I did. Once that''s done, I''ll briefly go over what I could do better and what I have planned for my lighting engine''s future.</p>\n', '<h2>The Light Map</h2>\n<p>The general method to my lighting engine is as follows:</p>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Create a new Frame Buffer (light map) to draw the light map on.</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Fill the light map with the ambient light color</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Draw the lights to the light map with an additive blend mode.</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Draw the light map over the game''s graphics component with a multiplicative blend mode.</span>\n<p>To add shadows, I do this for each light before I draw it to the light map:</p>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Draw the light image to another Frame Buffer (light buffer).</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Tint the light buffer with the light''s color by filling the light buffer with a color while using a multiplicative blend function.</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Draw the shadows over the light buffer in black.</span>\n<p>Here are some visuals to help you follow along. For comparison here is what the game looked like before I added any kind of lighting.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/1.jpg'' />\n<p>The first step is to create the light map and fill it with ambient light. For this demonstration, I am not using a blend function to draw the light map so it''s easier to see what''s going on.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/2.jpg'' />\n<p>Then, I draw each light over the light map.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/3.jpg'' />\n<p>For each light, I fill the light buffer with the light''s color using a multiplicative blend function. (Note, this is not the actual order of drawing, I would tint the image as I draw it. I separated the steps here to make it easier to follow.)</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/4.jpg'' />\n<p>Then for each light I remove the shadows (I''ll go over this later) by simply drawing a black polygon where the shadow should be. (Again, this should be done to the light buffer BEFORE drawing the light to the light map.)</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/5.jpg'' />\n<p>To add the lights to the light map in a "lighty" way, I draw each light buffer to the light map with an additive blend function. You can see the sources of light and their shadows very well here.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/6.jpg'' />\n<p>Now, when I draw the light map to the game''s scene I use a multiplicative blend function and TA-DAH, light has been born.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/7.jpg'' />\n<p>To make the render distance (which is determined by the light the character is holding) less harsh, I draw a simple vignette around the images (which is just a scaled, transparent, black image).</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/8.jpg'' />\n<p>And for a final comparison. The difference is night and day - lighting adds so much more to the game than I thought it would.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/9.jpg'' />\n<p>Here''s a live-action demo of the lighting in action. This video also features a giant horde of slimes and an OP player.</p>\n<iframe class=''youtubeVideo'' src=''http://www.youtube.com/embed/9hzpe24lHlo'' frameborder=''0'' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Shadows</h2>\n<p>I would not of been able to work out these shadows without the help of this video: <a href=''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FZIKX1Y_8I''>Here</a>. I would strongly suggest you watch that video if you really want to understand how this works as he gives a lot of good visuals. I will admit, I have become a bit of a graphics softie thanks to using Slick2D, so I adopted his method and came up with another, less efficient way to go about it.</p>\n<p>When I load the map, I create the 2D world with JBox2D based on a collision layer in the Tiled map. When I create a static wall with JBox2D, I also keep an array of lines (2 points) for each wall''s edge. I use these lines as "light blockers". After I draw the light image to the light buffer, I pass the light buffer, the lights position and other world data to a method. This method then goes through each of these shadow lines that intersect the light''s affected area.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/10.jpg'' />\n<p>This diagram shows the light image, 5 points, the shadow line and the triangle of light we''re working with. For each shadow line (here the line is A,B), you can make a triangle of light that should be shown (here it''s the triangle L,A,B). If we think of this triangle as a point and 2 vectors (point L with vectors L>A and L>B) we can scale the vectors equally to create a similar (larger) triangle (L,X,Y). Then, if we subtract the original triangle from this bigger one we end up with a polygon (A,X,Y,B) that encloses the space the shadow this line produces from this light. Once we have that polygon, we can simply draw it over the light buffer as so:</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/posts/2d-lighting-and-shadows/11.jpg'' />\n<p>I left the point of the light and the shadow line in this image for demonstration. Also note the dark grey is outside of the light buffer and is not actually drawn to the screen. This happens for every shadow line we have.</p>\n<h2>What I Could Do Better</h2>\n<p>There is one major thing I could do more efficiently, but for right now the system is alright as performance is not hurt too harshly from my not-so-efficient ways. As described in the above video, the best way to implement the 2D shadows is to draw a triangle fan that is constructed by clipping a quad where there is an intersecting shadow line with the light''s image as the texture. This would give many less draw calls and less resources. If I implemented it this way, each light could be drawn directly to the light map without the need of a separate buffer to draw the shadows.</p>\n<p>Another minor issue is the number of calculations per frame I have to make for each light. Most lights are static in their position. I don''t plan to have moving entities that create light shadows, so I could pre-calculate each triangle fan or shadow map when the light is generated. If I use this method, I would have to update any lights'' shadow maps when the surrounding environment changes (door opens, gate closes, etc).</p>\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n<p>The biggest thing I''d like to add in the future is a shader to blur the shadow edges. This would do a couple things:</p>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; It''s would ease the shadows by keeping the shadow/light contrast from being so sharp.</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; It would add the illusion of the umbra family. (more realistic lighting)</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; And finally it would allow the player to better see the edges of the surrounding walls'' textures which would add more character to each map.</span>\n<p>Another small thing I''d like to do is to adjust the blending function of the lights being drawn to the light map. Right now, things can become very "washed" when there are lights close together. In TWC I combated this with alpha blending, but lights that are drawn later still overpower lights drawn before it. I''m not sure if there is a better way to go about this blending, but I want there to be.</p>\n<p class=''subtitle''>PS: I would like to give a shout out to John Smith for this John Smith''s texture pack. I used textures from his Minecraft texture pack for this demo.</p>\n', '2D Lighting and Shadows', '2013-08-16 14:42:18'),

('a-new-start', '<p>January 1st, 2012. That was the day I started to “eat better” and it was brutal. It worked, and I made progress, but I was going the wrong way about it. I was going purely on my daily calorie intake; and I had cut it down to 800 calories/day. I wanted to lose weight and I didn’t want to exercise. The first few months seemed to go by pretty well; I was losing a steady 10 pounds a month. And then it stopped.</p>\n', '<p>I had read many times that a simple calorie deficit would do this: you’d lose weight quickly and then BAM! you’d plateau. The second you start eating more your body would begin gaining weight. As soon as this started to happen, I tried to retaliate. I started going to the gym.</p>\n<p>It was hard; due to my calorie deficit I was low on energy but it worked. I kept losing weight, little by little. I kept losing little by little until it slowly stopped. The last month of trying to lose weight, I lost none. I gave up. Summer had set in, nothing I was doing seemed to help me lose weight and my birthday was right around the corner. I lost 50 pounds in 6 months. From 321 pounds, I was down to 270 pounds. I was extremely happy.</p>\n<p>As summer went along, I started to slip. I’d have a burger here, some fires here, a bag of buttered popcorn, some potato chips with lunch and so on. I’ve gained 10 pounds since I stopped losing. Now, I haven’t reverted back to my old ways, I eat much better than I used to. I used to eat a family sized bag of chips by myself at night. I would drink 2 liters of normal Mountain Dew throughout the day. All I would eat was junk food and dinner. I don’t do that now, but I can still do better.</p>\n<p>Hitting 280 pounds again scared me. I seemingly “ruined my life” to lose all that weight and I was slowly gaining it back. I was not about to let that happen. It was time to get back on the bandwagon and shave off some more body fat. The last thing I wanted to do was NOT go on another calorie deficit diet. So I researched. I found /r/keto. The basis of the diet is no carbs. It’s very similar to the popular paleo (caveman) diet. You’re supposed to eat nothing but meat, vegetables, nuts and cheese. It’s supposed to get your body into “ketosis”, or back to using the fat reservoirs as energy instead of carbs.</p>\n<p>I loved the idea; it sounded like something I could do. And then I started thinking: no bread, no pasta, no rice, no potatoes, no starch and no sugar. I’m sure it would work, but I don’t know if it’s that practical. In this day in age you can’t eat out and avoid carbs, and there’s also too many temptations. I don’t know if I could never have a sandwich again, or some home-made pizza. The diet requires that you be strict for the full intended effect. So, I’m bagging it and coming up with a new regimen.</p>\n<p>But before I go there, I have to cover my realization. While reading and researching – I found out what I was doing wrong. I had the cause and effect backwards. My mindset was that I was eating better to lose weight. That’s the wrong way to think about it. I should be losing weight because I am eating better. And I should be eating better just to be healthier. If my cause to eat better is to lose weight, I’ll lose motivation the second I stop losing weight. But if my motivation to eat healthy, I’ll have all the motivation in the world.</p>\n<p>With this mentality, my goal to simply eat better and get fit. It’s hard to define what that means because everyone’s body is different, their mindsets are different and their standards are different. My main goal is keep carbs down. That means LESS starchy food. If I have rice, or pasta, it won’t be the main dish. If I have potatoes it won’t be fries or mashed potatoes. I want to eat more meat and vegetables and less grain. I don’t want a giant sub roll, but maybe a wrap, or just slices of bread. Instead of cheese and crackers, I’ll try to eat nuts and cheese. Instead of buttered popcorn, I’ll have yeast popcorn. Instead of mashed potatoes, I’ll have mashed cauliflower. Instead of frozen peas, I’ll have steamed spinach. Instead of battered, fried shrimp, I’ll have grilled or seared shrimp. I also want to keep up with the gym. That doesn’t mean the elliptical for 20 minutes once a week; I want to work towards getting fit. That means my whole body, from my calves to my abs to arms.</p>\n<p>All in all (TL;DR), I’m going to get back to attempting to lose weight. But not for the sake of losing weight, I want to for the sake of being healthy. I’m going try to have a better, more balanced diet instead of a simple daily calorie count. I want to go to the gym to improve my body, not to burn calories. I want to get healthy, not lose weight. But hey, losing weight would be nice too.</p>\n', 'A New Start', '2012-12-17 21:38:50'),
('adventure-time', '<p>In many projects I’ve worked on that resembled games, the movement was always the wall I’d hit and couldn’t get over. I often tried to dive head first, and reinvent the wheel with real physics, collision detection, proper resolution and so on. It was so overwhelming whenever I had previously attempted that I would end up disbanding the project.</p>\n', '<p>This time I took a step back and thought “the movement for this game doesn’t have to be complex. There’s no real time combat, there’s no need to go diagonal.” I decided I would make the movement much like the ever so popular Pokemon games. You move tile to tile, one at a time. You can never occupy more than one tile at a time, and you can’t go diagonal.</p>\n<p>This method of moving around the world became very easy to program. Collision was as simple as checking to see if the tile the player was trying to move into was occupied tile (by another entity), or was a “blocked” tile ID. While moving between tiles, I did a simple linear interpolation which allowed for a smooth, continuous walking movement if a player was to hold down a movement key.</p>\n<p>This method still allows for everything I needed: the ability to interact with other entities, go through “transportation/teleport” tiles, trigger combat and last but not least look good.

Not until now can I appreciate the time and effort some game developers put into the design and balance of their games.</p>\n', '<p>The biggest hurdle was balancing the multiple classes. At first, we were attempting to keep the classes similar in power but we ended up have 4 of the same classes with different skill names. It had the illusion of variance, but they all had the same underlying abilities. We came up with 4 final classes. I’ll go over each in detail.</p>\n<p>Mages offer strong magical offense and defense but cannot put out or take much physical damage. In addition to their raw damage mages can also inflict damaging conditions to their enemies. They have a very low base health.</p>\n<p>Rangers are the jack of all trades. Most damage and defense attributes are moderate. But rangers do have a one up in their dexterity and debilitation. With increased dexterity they are better at evading attacks and striking first. They are masters of conditions dealing damage over time and keeping enemy stats down.</p>\n<p>Warriors are the opposite of mages. They have very high endurance and strength as well as a high base health stat. They have a slow dexterity making them almost always attack last and have a hard time evading attacks. They’re clunky.</p>\n<p>Paladins can’t put out a lot of damage but they offer a lot of stat modifications. Paladins can heal team mates, remove conditions, buff team mate’s stats and lessen the enemies. They have a moderate amount of defense for both physical and magical damage. They have a low stamina, and can’t cast many strong spells in succession.</p>\n<p>In addition to the classes being constructed, I’ve documented available weapons for each class, and how they are used.

My main goal was to be able to work on certain parts of the project while other parts are still being pieced together. The game has multiple systems going on at the same time, but they don’t all rely on each other. The four main parts of the game will be: User Input, Screen Display, Game State Manager and the Role Playing Manager.</p>\n', '<p>The input system is pretty straight forward. Accessible to most object, subsystems can test for keystrokes, mouse movements and register listeners. Obviously I’ve separate the Keyboard and Mouse. Hopefully by constructing the input methods on the outside of the game itself, it will make it easier for things like player movement, in game menus and combat systems easier to hook into and not have to fight over each other.</p>\n<p>Next is the Screen Display system. This will also have access to the Game State Manager. Each game state will have it’s own drawing functionality, and the drawer class will simply call such a method. This allows for completely different drawing methods for each state allowing for a lot of customability in terms of the rendering for each game state. In turn it does create more work for me, but I think the trade off is worth the modularity I gain.</p>\n<p>The Game State Manager is the real meat of the program. This is what controls what parts of the game that are currently active. It will load new Combat States when the player encounters enemies, it will create new Adventure states when the player goes through doors, etc. This is what will allow the game to be more than a single camera in a 2D world.</p>\n<p>The Role Playing Manage is the meat of the game. The the State Manager controls the game’s state, while this will hold the players state. This will keep track of all quests, character stats, inventories, skill development, etc. All States will interact with this manager throughout gameplay.</p>\n<p>My goal for the near future is to setup the Display and Input Systems. Once that’s finished, I’ll begin work on the State Manager with a simple “dummy” state for the time being. I think getting these fundamental systems up and running is the first and biggest leap. Once that’s done, I can work on each system separately.</p>\n<p>I’ve enjoyed using UML (though I’m sure I’m not using it 100% accurately).

I am really happy with it and plan to eventually generate a tiled map given a tile set.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/sample-dungeon.png'' />\n<p>I stumbled upon this post on Reddit pretty quickly after searching for “procedural dungeon generation” on Google, <a href=''http://redd.it/1dlwc4''>Procedural Dungeon Generation Algorithm Explained by phidinh6</a>. The post outlines a pretty straight-forward approach to generate random rooms that do not intersect, and then connects them with hallways based on a connected graph. He easily lays it out and gives a nice demo that really helped me visualize the whole process, <a href=''http://tinykeep.com/dungen/''>here</a>.</p>\n<p>There were a couple steps that were easier said than done. The first being step 3; specifically “simple separation steering behavior to separate out all of the rectangles.” I couldn''t find anything on the internet that was directly related, but I was able to create something based on what I could see in his demo. The basic idea is to loop through each pair of rooms and shift both the least amount possible to get rid of any overlap. Keep doing so until no rooms overlap. Here’s some commented code to do this step:</p>\n<pre><code class=''language-java''>// a Room is a simple rectangle (x, y, width, height)\r\nprivate static void separateRooms() {\r\n  Room a, b; // to hold any two rooms that are over lapping\r\n  int dx, dxa, dxb, dy, dya, dyb; // holds delta values of the overlap\r\n  boolean touching; // a boolean flag to keep track of touching rooms\r\n  do {\r\n    touching = false;\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < rooms.size(); i++) {\r\n      a = rooms.get(i);\r\n      for (int j = i+1; j < rooms.size(); j++) { // for each pair of rooms (notice i+1)\r\n        b = rooms.get(j);\r\n        if (a.touches(b, padding)) { // if the two rooms touch (allowed to overlap by 1)\r\n          touching = true; // update the touching flag so the loop iterates again\r\n          // find the two smallest deltas required to stop the overlap\r\n          dx = Math.min(a.getRight()-b.getLeft()+padding, a.getLeft()-b.getRight()-padding);\r\n          dy = Math.min(a.getBottom()-b.getTop()+padding, a.getTop()-b.getBottom()-padding);\r\n          // only keep the smalled delta\r\n          if (Math.abs(dx) < Math.abs(dy)) dy = 0;\r\n          else dx = 0;\r\n          // create a delta for each rectangle as half the whole delta.\r\n          dxa = -dx/2;\r\n          dxb = dx+dxa;\r\n          // same for y\r\n          dya = -dy/2;\r\n          dyb = dy+dya;\r\n          // shift both rectangles\r\n          a.shift(dxa, dya);\r\n          b.shift(dxb, dyb);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  } while (touching); // loop until no rectangles are touching\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>He opts to use a <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation''>Delaunay Triangulation</a> trimmed with a <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree''>Minimal Spanning Tree</a> to connect the bigger rooms.

It created the loops to make the dungeons more complex while still minimally connecting all rooms. From Wikipedia:</p>\n<p class=''quote''>"(A RNG is an) undirected graph defined ... by connecting two points A and B by an edge whenever there does not exist a third point C that is closer to both A and B than they are to each other."</p>\n<p>Here''s my implementation:</p>\n<pre><code class=''language-java''>private static void connectRooms() {\r\n  Room a, b, c; // Rooms to check between\r\n  double abDist, acDist, bcDist; // squared distance between each of the 3 rooms\r\n  boolean skip;\r\n  for(int i = 0;i < corridors.size();i++) {\r\n    a = corridors.get(i);\r\n    for(int j = i+1;j < corridors.size();j++) { // for each pair of rooms\r\n      skip = false;\r\n      b = corridors.get(j);\r\n      // get the sqrd distance between a and b\r\n      abDist = Math.pow(a.getCenterX()-b.getCenterX(), 2) + Math.pow(a.getCenterY()-b.getCenterY(), 2);\r\n      for(int k = 0;k < corridors.size();k++) { // loop through all other rooms\r\n        if(k == i || k == j) // that are not a or b\r\n          continue;\r\n        c = corridors.get(k);\r\n        // get the other two applicable distances\r\n        acDist = Math.pow(a.getCenterX()-c.getCenterX(), 2) + Math.pow(a.getCenterY()-c.getCenterY(), 2);\r\n        bcDist = Math.pow(b.getCenterX()-c.getCenterX(), 2) + Math.pow(b.getCenterY()-c.getCenterY(), 2);\r\n        // if the distance between a and c or b and c are smaller than a, the pairing of\r\n        // a and b is not a graph edge\r\n        if(acDist < abDist && bcDist < abDist)\r\n          skip = true;\r\n        if(skip) // so we break the loop and go to the next a and b paring\r\n          break;\r\n      }\r\n      if(!skip) { // if this a and b pairing was never skipped, it should be an edge\r\n        if(graph.get(a) == null)\r\n          graph.put(a, new LinkedList<Room>());\r\n        graph.get(a).add(b);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>After these rooms are connected, I needed to generate the hallways required to traverse between them. I wanted the hallways to randomly bend from A to B either clockwise or counter clockwise which caused me some trouble. So much so I needed to look for help at Stack Exchange, <a href=''http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/75360/connecting-two-arbitrary-points-with-2-lines/75372#75372''>here</a>. Thanks to Heckle''s suggestion I was able to find a way to connect the two rooms with connected hallways. There''s a code example on the Stack Exchange page.</p>\n<p>Once I was able to connect the big rooms with hallways, it''s simply a matter of drawing the rooms, smaller corridors and hallways to an image. Pixels can translate directly to tiles, so I plan to generate tile maps based on these generated images. This Image shows a (messy) more detailed result of my methods.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/img/sample-dungeon-detailed.png'' />\n<p>And here''s a final result.

I said that I was thinking of using the Keto dieting method, but I ruled it too difficult in the world we live in today. The Keto diet has only one restriction: stick below ~25g of carbohydrates a day. In doing so, you force your body to start using Fat as its primary source of energy instead of carbohydrates. Over time your body stops using carbohydrates as energy and uses all fat. This literately forces your body to begin eating away at your body fat, instead of a steady stream of carbohydrates.</p>\n', '<p>This diet limits your available options a lot. Things like bread, noodles, non-diet sodas, ice cream, 2% milk, potatoes, fruits, juices, etc are all no-goes. This is why it was so daunting.

Monday night, I spontaneously said to myself, “Why not? Lets just try out Keto…” From that point on, I’ve been at less than 20g of carbs per day. I have done so with a lot of guidance from /r/keto. The Keto sub-Reddit has posted so many successful progress pictures, testimonials, and proof that Keto works, that I just HAD to try it out.</p>\n<p>The first day was the worst. I hadn’t “Keto” shopped yet, and I was craving food badly. All I had was a bag of almonds, some cheese and roast beef. Thankfully we had steak that night. All day I was craving things like bread, or pretzels. Two days go on, and I keep a strict Keto diet. During these days, I started to get the predicted symptoms. I felt fatigued, and out of energy, my mouth tasted like a tin can, etc.</p>\n<p>On day 4, I decide to pickup some Ketostix on the way to work – they test to see if your body is producing ketones (a byproduct of burning fat for energy). I get to work, and sure enough I am in ketosis – SAWEET! Friday and today (Saturday) have been eye opening. This is the first time where I have truly not been “hungry” in my recent memory. I didn’t crave food, and when I did just a little amount of food would fill me up. Some restaurant meticulously placed a basket of bread in front of me – but I was unturned. Sure, it smelled good, but I didn’t crave it. I didn’t feel like I needed to eat.</p>\n<p>Almost a week in, and I’ve lost my predicted 5 pounds of water weight, plus an additional 5 pounds of fat.

In my implementation the rooms were rectangles, connected by hallways that would turn at 90 degrees - perfect for a dungeon.

('science-vs-technilogy', '<p>In my "Science, Technology and Society" course at <a href=''http://www.vtc.edu/''>VTC</a> we were asked: What is <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science''>Science</a>? What is <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology''>Technology</a>? And, how are they <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_and_technology''>related</a>? It was apparent that everyone in the class had different opinions on their meanings and relation. I found the discussion afterwards and the related reading interesting enough that I wanted to find out what other people thought. So, I decided to send a survey around asking people to do as my class did; here are my findings.</p>\n', '<p class=''subtitle''>Just wanna see the data? Jump to the <a href=''#results''>Results</a>.</p>\n<p>I compiled all of my data into an MS Excel spreadsheet for those of you who would like to look at it themselves. I will be referencing the difference sheets in this document throughout this post. You can download it: <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/data.xlsx''>here</a>.</p>\n<h1>The Survey</h1>\n<p>The survey I put together aimed to gather some basic information about the surveyee''s definition and relation of Science and Technology. It consisted of the following questions:</p>\n<p class=''quote''>Describe "Science/Technology" in a few words. (2 Questions)</p>\n<p>The goal of these questions was to find what keywords people used when describing Science or Technology. By gathering the words used describe the terms, we should be able to find a pretty accurate definition via related words and synonyms.</p>\n<p class=''quote''>How closely related is "Science" to "Technology"?</p>\n<p>Obviously, there is a distinction between Science and Technology but they do share many similar aspects. They also heavily influence each other blurring the line between them even further. The surveyee was asked to give a rating from 1-10 where 1 is "They''re totally different" and 10 is "They''re the same thing."</p>\n<p class=''quote''>How much does "Science/Technology" directly influence your life? (2 Questions)</p>\n<p>Considering how closely related they both are, I wanted to find out which of the two people were more influenced by. People were asked to rate the influence of both (separately) on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is "It doesn''t effect me at all" and 10 is "Science/Technology is large part of my life."</p>\n<p class=''quote''>What''s more important to the advancement of the human kind?</p>\n<p>This question took the previous one, and abstracted it to the whole of the humankind, instead of the individual.</p>\n<p class=''quote''>(Optional) What is your gender?</p>\n<p>This one was just to find the differences in responses based gender. It was optional and not really necessary - but sometimes it''s fun to see the social differences between genders.</p>\n<h2>Like a Virus</h2>\n<p>I created this survey with <a href=''http://www.google.com/forms/about/''>Google Forms</a> and shared it on my <a href=''https://www.facebook.com/fisherevans''>Facebook</a> asking my friends to fill it out and share it. I was only expecting a handful of responses but within a day my post was "shared" by multiple people, and I had people asking for my findings when I was done. I spent the following days waiting for the results to slow down to a point where I thought I had gotten a good enough sample size. By this time I knew I was going to have to do a full write up due to final scale of this little project.</p>\n<p>I released the survey at 9am on Wednesday (1/28/15), and closed submissions at 1pm on Saturday (1/31/15). Over that time I was able to gather 117 responses including 1 double submission and 1 "troll" submission. This left me with 115 unique, valid form responses. Awesome. Time to start doing something with all this data.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/submissions.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>The rate of form submissions per hour while the survey was open.</p>\n<h1>Processing the Submissions</h1>\n<p>Google Forms dumps all the data collected into a giant Google Spreadsheet. It''s a great medium for the submissions but it''s difficult to get more intricate statistics from that. To do anything fun with the data I had to restructure it into a more accessible format.</p>\n<h2>The Database</h2>\n<p>I decided to store everything in a small database. The 1-10 scale ratings were no big deal to store, but for the Science/Technology keywords I had mold the data a little. The main task was to map words to their "root meaning." For example, the following: explore, explores, exploring, explorers and explored; should be represented as one word, explore. I also had to ignore common, non-descriptive words like the, an or and. (You can see the mappings I chose in the "Keyword Mappings" sheet of the Excel Spreadsheet linked below.)</p>\n<p>The final table structure for this database was small, but served it''s purpose. It contained a main table, "submissions," that held all the multiple choice answers, a "word" table that stored all the used words and what they mapped to, and a "words" table that associated what words each submission used to describe either category (Science or Technology.)</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/db.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>The database schema design.</p>\n<!-- raw --><a name="results"></a>\n<h1>The Results</h1>\n<p>All of these results can be found within the various sheets in this <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/data.xlsx''>MS Excel Spreadsheet</a>. (That also includes the SQL dump of the tables and the SQL queries used to find the results.)</p>\n<p>Overall, about a third of the submissions were male, two thirds were female and a handful of submissions that didn''t specify. Keep in mind that due to this, female submissions will look about 50% larger than males in the following charts, making it difficult to visually compare male to female data.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/gender_ratio.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>The proportions of male, female and other submissions.</p>\n<h2>Influence</h2>\n<p>On average, when asked to rate the personal influence of Science and Technology, people said that science was rated at 7.9 and Technology at 8.5. Though the average was close, the standard deviation is far different between the two. The Science ratings were more evenly distributed in the 6-10 range, where Technology had an overwhelming peak right at 10.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/per_inf_sci.png'' />\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/per_inf_tech.png'' />\n<p>When rating Technology, the gender distribution was about even, but for Science there is a clear difference. Almost no males rated Science at a 10, where nearly half the female submissions rated it a 10.</p>\n<p>In general though, people considered Technology to be more influential in their lives. When asked which was more important to (the advancement of) the humankind though, Science came out well on top (if we consider "Equal" to be neutral.)</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/human_kind.png'' />\n<h2>Keywords</h2>\n<p>When processing the term definitions/keywords I originally just counted the number of times a word was used amongst all the submissions and ranked the words in order uses. However, I noticed that someone who offered a longer definition had a stronger influence on the results then someone who gave a more precise response. While a longer response may offer a "better," more detailed definition, this survey was looking for average definition. To accomplish equal representation for each surveyee I weighed the word usage based on the number words used in a surveyee''s definition. (If someone used 4 words in their definition, each of there word uses would be counted as 0.25 uses.)</p>\n<p>On average, surveyees used 3.5 words to describe each term. But there is also an interesting group of people who used 8 words to define the terms. Here''s distribution of words per submission.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/keyword_count.png'' />\n<h3>Science</h3>\n<p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, <a href=''http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science''>Science</a> is the "knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation." The top 5 words used to describe Science were: knowledge, fact, proof, test and explore. At least this little experiment shows that the social definition is pretty close to the technical definition.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/weighted/total.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Science ordered by overall usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/non-weighted/total.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<p>Some interesting things emerge when you rank the words based on genered usage however. Notice how one gender frequently uses words to describe Science that the other never does. For example, the top Science keyword for males was "understand," very few females used this word. On the flip side, the 2nd most used keyword for Science was "interesting." Not one male used that word in their description. The trend is visible for a lot of the words listed below.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/weighted/male.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Science ordered by male usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/non-weighted/male.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/weighted/female.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Science ordered by female usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/science/non-weighted/female.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n<p><a href=''http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/technology''>Dictionary.com</a> defines Technology as the knoweldge involved with creation and use of technical means, or the application of such knoweldge. I think this survey shows again that the social definition is pretty spot on with some of the top ranking words being: tool, application, science and make.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/weighted/total.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Technology ordered by overall usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/non-weighted/total.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<p>Similar to Science, the gender distribution between Technology keywords is pretty interesting. Take a look at the top two keywords: application and tool. Both are dominated by one gender. There are few male dominated words for Technology, but a lot of the top 10 for female keywords were rarely used by males: future, make, life, advance, innovation, etc.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/weighted/male.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Technology ordered by male usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/non-weighted/male.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/weighted/female.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Weighted keywords describing Technology ordered by female usage. View the non-weighted version <a href=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/keywords/technology/non-weighted/female.png''>here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Them</h3>\n<p>One of the questions on my survey also asked people to rate the similarity between Science and Technology. With 1 meaning they''re totally different and 10 meaning they''re the same thing the average surveyee rated the similarity at 6.9 (male average: 6.7. female: 7.1). The rating isn''t on a finite scale and the result is up to interpretation, but in general it seems that people think that the two are fairly similar to each other.</p>\n<img class=''portrait'' src=''/res/sci_tech_surv/img/ratings/sci_eq_tech.png'' />\n<p class=''subtitle''>Submission ratings of the similarity between Science and Technology.</p>\n<p>If we take the intersection between the top 15 keywords for both Science and Technology we find that the following words were used to describe both: things, life, and world. You can come to a lot of conclusions, but I''d like to think that the relationship is that Science is the knowledge of, and Technology is application or tools of the things in this world that affect our lives. But that might just be wishful thinking. If we expand the keyword count to 25 from 15, we also find that advance enters the intersection implying that both do in fact advance the human kind.</p>\n<h1>Reflections</h1>\n', 'Science vs. Technology', '2011-01-31 17:07:35'),
('slick2d-and-states', '<p>After a lot of thought and a lot of reading I’ve decided to go with Slick2D for the rendering of the game. I’ll also be utilizing the inner game loop Slick2D offers. Slick2D also offers many listeners for user input that’s a bit more functional and aimed towards games. Because of this change, the overall design of the software has changed.</p>\n', '<p>The GameDriver object is the main class of the game. Each system has a Manager class. The driver will extend the Slick2D game object which inherits the automatic game loop. This takes care of the render calls and delta calculations. The driver also inherits the display with very little configuration. Slick2D has done a lot of the graphics work that was a little daunting to me but one thing I’d like to make a point of is that I’m not trying to cut corners, but I wasn’t about to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing I accomplished since my last post was the StateManager. I’ve made a very simple, but powerful StateManager that the driver uses. A State acts as an input listener, updater and renderer. Each loop, the driver tells the state manager to udpate and draw the current state. It is very easy to dynamically create and set new states. States can create and set other states themselves.</p>\n<p>For example, while in an AdventureState, you could trigger a fight. The AdventureState would generate a CombatState, and pass itself. Then the AdvnetureState would set the current state to the generated CombatState. Once the fighting has finished, the CombatState simply sets the current state as the passed AdventureState.</p>\n<p>This state system allows each State to have its own update function and render function. It also allows for states to force an update or render of other states. I’ll be using this with the pause menu. Allowing me to render the adventure state (but not update it), and render the menu right over it.</p>\n<p>The next step will be to start work on the RPGManager. This is what will handle any save files, character stats, quests, inventories, and so on. In the process of this, I will also have to figure out how to construct the quest system and the skill branching. I believe these will be the hardest part in this manager as both become very complex. Thankfully, I think they’ll both be very similar and I’ll be able to learn from the other.</p>\n<p>I still have a lot ahead of me, but I am ecstatic about the progress I’ve made. I’ve had a wonderful time working on this including all the leaps and hurdles. My goal is to have a finished product by the end of my summer break. At this rate, I feel I’ll be pretty close to my target.</p>\n', 'Slick2D and States', '2012-11-25 21:36:41'),
('story-lore-and-characters', '<p>It seems like every step I’ve made towards making this game is more difficult than the last. Thankfully it just keeps getting more and more fun. One of the major roadblocks preventing the game from progressing more was the lack of a solid story the game was based on. Thanks to the help from my little brother, Jack, I’ve finally made some headway. When I was trying to come up with ideas for the story there were a few things I was trying to avoid.</p>\n', '<p>The last thing I wanted was for my story to be completely linear. I don’t necessarily mean quest wise, but more story wise. In the original Mario, there is a very straight forward story: Princess kidnapped; rescue princess; get kissed. I wanted twists, multiple characters, intertwined stories; I wanted my game to be fun to play and fun to follow.</p>\n<p>I also didn’t want the story to be too generic. Again, the princess rescue squad has been done a thousand times. The story I came up with may a generic foundation of an idea, but I hope the way I executed it makes it stand out form other games.</p>\n<p>With any story, characters are important. Because of this, I wanted my characters to be more than relatable, but believable as well. In Pokemon, the main character defeats a national crime ring every year at the age of 10. while the audience can relate to the main character, I find it hard to believe a 10 year old is more effective than the Celadon police department. I feel like the characters made and their actions are believable as well that the player is able to relate to them.</p>\n<p>In short the story is simple. The main character’s father vanishes when he is a child. When he grows older, he finds clues to his father’s location. While searching for his father, he gets tied up in a rebellion and a greater force of evil. It’s a combination of 3 main plots going on at the same time.</p>\n<p>In addition to coming up with a story, we also came up with most of the main characters. Each character is some how related to the main character, and has their own goals and age. We hope this will help coming up with quests later on.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into more detail here about the story or characters but please read up on them here: Google Docs. Till next time!</p>\n', 'Story, Lore and Characters', '2012-11-29 21:37:23'),
('twc', '<p>For a long, long time I’ve wanted to make something that would bring entertainment and joy to peoples’ lives. I’ve made my fair share of simple programs that do pretty mundane tasks and I think it’s time I take a stab at a bigger project. A DJ that I listen to often (Tiesto) was once asked in an interview: “Why do you make the music you make?” to which his response was: “I make music that I want to listen to.” That really hit home to me as I am sure it would with many people. The last thing I want to do is dedicate my life to something I don’t like or don’t want to do.</p>\n', '<p>That brings me to the game. As one would assume, I’ve always enjoyed a good role playing game. Titles such as Golden Sun, Final Fantasy and Pokemon are what defined my childhood. I don’t plan on making the biggest game title this year, but I also don’t expect to buckle up for a weekend and make a game. I want to make a product from start to finish the way it’s meant to be developed. To me, this means everything from UML to Documentation to testers. Granted this won’t be a project of a lifetime, there probably won’t be more than a couple friends involved with making the game, but I want my first “real project” to be done right to help set the path for the rest of my career.</p>\n<p>The first question is obviously: What language? Java is the language I know best. I also am a big fan of Java’s motto “Compile once, run anywhere”. Of course that motto isn’t 100% accurate, but the idea just makes too much sense. Constructing this game in Java would allow for Windows users, Mac users and Linux users to play the final product. It would also allow for easy translation to an Android app if the future holds such a path.</p>\n<p>I’ve already started working on a small “Design Doc”. It’s not structured correctly yet, it’s still more of a notepad I’ve used to keep my ideas straight. You can find the current Design Document here: Chaotic Harmony. The goal is to create a game similar to Golden Sun, my favorite game series. I want to make the game a kind of homage to Golden Sun – while introducing aspects of different games like Final Fantasy.</p>\n<p>As many RPGs, I want to the biggest part (other than the story) to be the combat. Combat will hold many options allowing users to create combos with multiple characters, moderated attacks and an advanced turn based system. I look forward to working on this game further and keeping people updated via this Blog of mine.</p>\n', 'The Wayward Crown', '2012-11-23 13:27:47');

Test.java has a few methods with different combinations of return types and parameters.</p>\n<pre><code class=''language-java''>public class Test {\r\n    /* The channel to register this object with */\r\n    public static final Class CHANNEL = Test.class;\r\n    \r\n    /* Pre-defined action IDs */\r\n    public static final long ACTION_1 = 1;\r\n    public static final long ACTION_2 = 2;\r\n    public static final long ACTION_3 = 3;\r\n    \r\n    @EventAction(ACTION_1)\r\n    public void helloWorld() {\r\n        hello("World");\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @EventAction(ACTION_2)\r\n    public void hello(String name) {\r\n        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @EventAction(ACTION_3)\r\n    public Integer square(Integer x) {\r\n        return x*x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the code above there are 2 real sections: Event Router variables, and Event Router Actions. The variables aren''t necessary, but keeping them as static fields help read the code later. For each of the methods I defined them as event actions all with separate Action IDs (but there''s nothing stopping you from using the same actions code for multiple methods, they will just be called when that Action ID is called). You can use the <code class=''inline language-java''>@EventActions(long ... actionIDs)</code> annotation to register a method to multiple action IDs.</p>\n<p>Event Actions can take parameters, return Objects, and throw Exceptions. When called through the Event Router, a <code class=''inline language-java''>EventActionSendResult</code> object is returned which holds all of the result data from each action call. Now that we have a sample class defined, we can now begin using the Event Router.</p>\n<pre><code class=''language-java''>public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    // Initialize the event router and subscribe the test object\r\n    EventRouter.init();\r\n    Test testObj = new Test();\r\n    EventRouter.subscribe(testObj, Test.CHANNEL);\r\n    \r\n    // Prints "Hello, World!"\r\n    EventRouter.send(Test.CHANNEL, Test.ACTION_1);\r\n    \r\n    // Prints "Hello, Fisher!"\r\n    EventRouter.send(Test.CHANNEL, Test.ACTION_2, "Fisher");\r\n    \r\n    // Returns the square of 4, 16\r\n    EventActionSendResult result = EventRouter.send(Test.CHANNEL, Test.ACTION_3, 4);\r\n    Integer square = result.getResults().get(0);\r\n    // Prints "4*4 = 16"\r\n    System.out.println("Confirm 4*4 = " + result);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>First off, we initialize the EventRouter which creates the basic data structures behind the scenes. Calling <code class=''inline language-java''>EventRouter.init()</code> at a later point will un-register ALL EventActions and Objects. After creating a new Test object (testObj) we register it with the Event Router for the Channel defined as a static field in Test.java. Once testObj is registered, we call two basic actions. The first calls <code class=''inline language-java''>void helloWorld()</code> which is registered to <code class=''inline language-java''>Test.ACTION_1</code>; it takes no parameter and returns no value. Next we called <code class=''inline language-java''>void hello(String name)</code> which is registered to <code class=''inline language-java''>Test.ACTION_2</code> and passed the String "Fisher". The third is a little more complex, it takes a parameter and returns a computed result. The <code class=''inline language-java''>EventRouter.send(...)</code> method returns a <code class=''inline language-java''>EventActionSendResult</code> which we use to capture the returned value from <code class=''inline language-java''>Integer square(Integer x)</code>.</p>\n<p class=''subtitle''>For a more detailed example, you can see the Test.java class in the GitHub project <a href=''https://github.com/fisherevans/EventRouter/blob/master/src/com/fisherevans/eventRouter/test/Test.java''>here</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- end block -->\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Dynamic method calls which support return value, parameters and Exceptions.</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; The ability to use Weak References</span>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; Easy to use API</span>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; <a href=''https://github.com/fisherevans/EventRouter''>GitHub Project</a></span>\n', 'Event Router', '/img/default_project.png'),

I put a lot of work into TWC and loved every minute of it. In the process I had built a small team of two artists, a music composer, a story writer and myself.</p>\n<p>Sadly, after a a couple months of work, I realized how big of a bite I had taken to chew. Things started falling on top of each other and I was the only one there to put it back together. I slowly lost motivation and eventually stopped working on the project.</p>\n<p>But, I never wanted to stop working on this game. Thanks to my brother (Jack, the story writer), I got the motivation to start work on a game again. This time it would be a smaller project; something I could handle.</p>\n<p>LRK is a prequel to TWC. This cut back on a lot of the lore we needed, story boarding and general theme of the game. It''s also based on the same Game Engine (Slick2D), so my struggles with TWC earlier in the year are paying off as experience. The game mechanics are simple, and well defined. Everything about it has been scaled down, and is now much more manageable for a small team (with one developer: me).</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<span class=''bullet''>&#8226; <a href=''https://github.com/fisherevans/LRK''>GitHub Project Page</a></span>\n', 'Lost Relics of Kazar', '/img/lrk.png'),
