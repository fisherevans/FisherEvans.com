      Hello!
      - want some extra coins? check out the "For Sale" board game box.
      - here's a hint.. try brute forcing the password
      - pay attention to the error messages.
      - otherwise, there's nothing for you to see here.
      - the password is just checked against the rules you get in the UI
      - the literal password is not in the source code
      - the account number is pretty obsufcated
      - it would probably take more time to reverse engineer it than to solve the password puzzle.
